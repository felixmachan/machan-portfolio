            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p class="section-lead" style="max-width: 80% !important">MPTRhome is a modular home IoT management system designed to unify heterogeneous smart devices into a single, controllable platform. The system focuses on practical usability, local-first operation, and extensibility, targeting both commercial off-the-shelf and custom-built IoT hardware.</p>

                <h3>Problem</h3>
                <p>Most home automation ecosystems are fragmented: different protocols, closed ecosystems, cloud dependency, and limited customization. Integrating Zigbee, Wi-Fi, and custom IoT devices into a single system often requires multiple tools and complex configuration, which is inefficient and hard to maintain.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="project-row">
                <h3>Goal</h3>
                <p>The goal was to design a centralized IoT management system that can discover, register, monitor, and control diverse devices through a unified interface, while remaining scalable, protocol-agnostic, and suitable for custom hardware integrations.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="project-row">
                <h3>Approach</h3>
                <p>The system was designed around a modular backend architecture with clear separation between device discovery, communication, and data persistence. Standard protocols (e.g. Zigbee, MQTT, HTTP) are abstracted behind a common device model, allowing both commercial and custom IoT devices to be handled uniformly. Emphasis was placed on local operation, reliability, and long-term maintainability.
