                  <h2>Problem</h2>
                  <p>Most home automation ecosystems are fragmented: different protocols, closed ecosystems, cloud dependency, and limited customization. Integrating Zigbee, Wi-Fi, and custom IoT devices into a single system often requires multiple tools and complex configuration, which is inefficient and hard to maintain.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="project-row">
                    <h2>Goal</h2>
                    <p>The goal was to design a centralized IoT management system that can discover, register, monitor, and control diverse devices through a unified interface, while remaining scalable, protocol-agnostic, and suitable for custom hardware integrations.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="project-row">
                  <h2 style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Approach</h2>

                  <div class="reveal">
                    <h3>Dashboard</h3>
                    <p>The main dashboard provides a quick overview of the entire smart home network. It summarizes key device statuses, active scenes, and recent events, offering a centralized starting point for monitoring and control. Users can quickly assess the state of their home and navigate to specific areas for more detailed interaction.
                      Users can see their Rooms and device cards referenced in those rooms. Custom made quick actions can be placed on the dashboard for easy access to frequently used automations or device controls. Additional helper widgets can be added as well.
                    </p>

                  </div>

                  <div class="reveal">
                    <h3>Devices Page</h3>
                    <p>The devices page lists all connected hardware, regardless of its underlying protocol. From here, users can add new devices via a guided discovery process.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Device List</h4>
                    <p>This view shows all connected devices, their status, and the rooms they are assigned to. It serves as the central hub for managing all hardware in the system.</p>
                    <img src="../assets/img/mptrhome/devices.avif" alt="Device List" class="project-gallery__image" />

                    <h4>Adding a New Device</h4>
                    <p>Users can add new devices to the system database via this page. Permit join button allows new devices to be discovered and added via the Zigbee engine behind the scenes, Zigbee2MQTT. The search button initiates the scanning of the devices connected to the network. 
                      The user can then select the device they want to add from the list of discovered devices.
                    </p>
                    <img src="../assets/img/mptrhome/Addevicepage.avif" alt="Add Device" class="project-gallery__image" />

                    <h4>Post-adding Configuration</h4>
                    <p>After a device is added, it appears in the configuration panel, where it can be assigned a name and a room before being finalized into the system. If the system failed at identifying the device type (e.g. Temperature Sensor), the user can correct it here.</p>
                    <img src="../assets/img/mptrhome/configdeviceafteradd.avif" alt="Configure Device" class="project-gallery__image" />
                    <h4>Device Page</h4>
                    <p>Each device has its own dedicated page that exposes all its controllable entities, such as switches, sensors, or lights. Users can interact with the device in real-time from this interface. In the top row, users can see the most important data of the specific device, chosen by the user in the device settings page.</p>
                    <img src="../assets/img/mptrhome/Devicepage.avif" alt="Device Page" class="project-gallery__image" />

                    <h4>Data Visualization</h4>
                    <p>For devices that produce time-series data (like temperature or energy sensors), the system automatically generates historical graphs. This allows users to track trends and monitor device performance over time. There are multiple chart views, like real time, last hour, year, and custom ranges.</p>
                    <img src="../assets/img/mptrhome/devicepage_datavisualization.avif" alt="Data Visualization" class="project-gallery__image" />

                    <h3>Device Settings</h3>
                    <p>Each device has a dedicated settings panel where users can fine-tune its behavior. This includes changing the device name, assigning it to a different area, or viewing detailed entity information. The system also provides a straightforward process for choosing the desired data to plot, or to send alerts about. Alerts can be sent to an email address, and the logical criteria for triggering these alerts can be customized.</p>
                    <img src="../assets/img/mptrhome/devicesettins1.avif" alt="Device Settings 1" class="project-gallery__image" />

                    <h3>Automations</h3>
                    <p>The automations engine allows users to create powerful, event-driven workflows. Rules can be defined based on device triggers (e.g., a sensor detecting motion), time schedules, or system events. The interface supports creating, editing, and duplicating automations, with shortcuts for quick access to frequently used rules.</p>

                    <h4>Trigger definition</h4>
                    <p>The user can create automations with numerous settings to define triggers, conditions, and actions. User can implement complex logic with OR and AND conditions to tailor the automation behavior precisely. Trigger can be a recurring date/hour, or a device event. </p>
                    <img src="../assets/img/mptrhome/automations1.avif" alt="Automations" class="project-gallery__image" />

                    <h4>Action definition</h4>
                    <p>The user can set the action triggered by the trigger. Multiple ones can be implemented independently.</p>
                    <h4>Manual automations</h4>
                    <p>Users can set up automations that require manual activation, providing flexibility for user-initiated actions. Manual automations can be tied to a quick action button, which makes it easy to fire the automation with a single click.</p>
                    <img src="../assets/img/mptrhome/automations2.avif" alt="Editing an Automation" class="project-gallery__image" />

                    <h4>My Automations</h4>
