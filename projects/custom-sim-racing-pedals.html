                <h3>Problem</h3>
                <p>I have been sim racing for several years, but this hobby is quite an expensive one. I wanted to upgrade my pedals to a loadcell based system for better accuracy and realism., but the prices were prohibitively high for my budget. This was the time that I decided to build my own set of custom pedals.</p>

              <div class="project-row">
                <h3>Goal</h3>
                <p>To design and build a cost-effective, high-performance set of sim racing pedals that provide realistic feedback and durability.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="project-row">
                <h3>Approach</h3>
                <p>Of course the first step was a bit of research and planning to understand the requirements and constraints. Most professional pedals use the sheet metal approach. I thought a CNC-machined design would offer better precision and durability, and also allow for a more custom look. 
                  I started by the mechanical design, with the consideration of the utilization of load cells and high quality, high precision hall sensors. Using these types of sensors would ensure accurate and reliable input for the sim racing experience. The loadcell, in comparison with the traditional potentiometer based pedals, provides a more realistic and consistent feel, as it measures the actual force applied to the pedal rather than just the position. This results in a more immersive and authentic driving experience. The throttle and clutch pedals utilize hall sensors for position sensing, which are contactless and provide high precision and durability.
